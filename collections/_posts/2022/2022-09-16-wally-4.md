Wally 4.0 is out! It has been rewritten from scratch and has a bunch of new features, such as support for many new item types, tags, search, stunning new skins etc.

![iOS devices running Wally]({{page.image-trans}} "Wally 4.0")

Wally 4 has been rewritten from scratch for iOS and iPadOS 16. It uses the latest technologies from Apple to bring you an app that is a lot more polished than before, with a new desktop-like experience on iPad.

Wally now lets you store more things in your wallet, with receipts, business cards, photos and notes being added as new types. Make sure to check back for more item-specific functionality in the future, such as being able to call contacts.

Wally also lets you select from a (yet small) collection of skins, such as blue and brown leather. This changes the look of the entire app, and lets you find a style that fits you. Don't hesistate to reach out with suggestions for more skins.

Wally 4 lets you organize your wallet with tags, which can be used to group items together. You can also search among your content to quickly find the item you're looking for.
