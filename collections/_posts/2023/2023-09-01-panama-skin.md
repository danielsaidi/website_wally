Wally 4 was launched a year ago, and added the support for skins, which lets you personalize your wallet with different materials.

The app has so far had a standard, black leather theme, a delicate, blue leather theme and a classic, brown leather theme without a name.

Panama will join this family of beautiful leather skins in the upcoming 4.2 release, and brings a green, calm alternative for your everyday zen life.

Wally 4.2 will be out soon. Make sure to keep an eye on this blog and follow Wally on [Twitter]({{site.twitter_url}}) and [Instagram]({{site.instagram_url}}) for the latest updates.
