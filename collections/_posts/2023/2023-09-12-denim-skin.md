Wally 4.2 added the first new skin since skins were introduced over a year ago. [Panama]({{page.panama}}) added a calm, green variant to the leather family.

Wall 4.3 will add a brand new skin type to the mix. Denim is the first of many denim-based skin to be added to the app. It's classic, it's blue, it's denim...and it's beautiful.

Wally 4.3 will be out soon. Make sure to keep an eye on this blog and follow Wally on [Twitter]({{site.twitter_url}}) and [Instagram]({{site.instagram_url}}) for the latest updates.
