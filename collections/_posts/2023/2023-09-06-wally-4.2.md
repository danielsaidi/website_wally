Wally 4.2 is out, with a brand new skin, support for the Shortcuts app, some UI tweaks and a couple of important bug fixes. 

![iOS devices running Wally]({{page.image}} "Wally 4.2")


## New skin

Wally 4.2 adds a brand new skin to premium users. [Panama]({{page.panama}}) has green, delicate leather and white, discrete stitches. We hope you love it as much as we do.


## Shortcuts

Wally 4.2 adds support for the Shortcuts app. Your shortcuts can now link to any item in your wallet. Note that you must still authenticate yourself with Face ID or Touch ID to access your wallet.


## UI adjustments

Photos can now be expanded on iPad, which lets you watch them in greater detail than before. The premium screen also replaces the solid button background with a beautiful glass panel.

There are also more tweaks in the main menu, and the settings screen replaces all individual item search toggles with a single toggle for all item types.


## Bug fixes

Wally 4.2 makes business cards and photos resize properly when you use the size slider to resize them. There are also an important bug fix that makes it possible to import data files from iCloud.


## Conclusion

These are some the many changes in Wally 4.2. We hope you will love it. 

Wally 4.2 can be downloaded [here]({{site.appstore_url}}).
