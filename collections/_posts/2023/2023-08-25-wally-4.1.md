Wally 4.1 is out, with a bunch of improvements that make the app more delightful to use.

![iOS devices running Wally]({{page.image}} "Wally 4.2")


## Main menu

Wally 4.1 restructures the main menu and groups things in a nicer way. The tag menus are also moved from the main menu to each item list screen.


## Settings

The settings screen has been cleaned up, and will only show settings for the item types that you have added.


## Premium

The premium screen has been redesigned to better show the premium features and to make it easier to find links to the terms & conditions, privacy policy, subscription management, etc.


## Search

Search has been improved and is now case-insensitive. The current search query will also apply when you go to the edit screen, so that only the currently filtered items show up.


## Conclusion

These are a few of the many changes in Wally 4.1. We hope you will love it.
