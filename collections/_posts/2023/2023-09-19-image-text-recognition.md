Wally will now use on-device machine-learning capabilities to recognize text in your images when you edit your things.

All recognized text will be added to a convenient popup menu next to the various text fields. Just tap the menu and pick a text to add it to the text field.

This will make it a lot easier for you to add information to your things. Instead of typing text by hand, just tap the menu and pick from any recognized text.
