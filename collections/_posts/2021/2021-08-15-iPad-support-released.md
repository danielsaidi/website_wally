iPad support has finally been released! It is available in the upcoming 3.2 version and lets you access your cards on all your mobile Apple devices.

As you are not able to use Wally on all your mobile Apple devices, you may want to sync data between them. However, Wally does not support automatic data sync, since that would require you to store you sensitive data on a shared location. Instead, you can send single cards as well as your entire wallet between your devices directly from the app.

I'm really excited to bring Wally to the iPad and hope to be able to add even more device types and platform to the list during autumn. I'd also love to hear what you think about the brand new version of the app and the new features it brings, so don't hesitate to reach out and share your experience.
