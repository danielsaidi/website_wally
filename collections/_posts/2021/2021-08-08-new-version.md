The Wally app for iOS has been around for 9 years, but it isn't until now that it has been properly rewritten to make way for new exciting features. We'd love to tell you all about it.


## The history of Wally

Wally was created with the intention of being a super simple utility app, with focus on simplicity and security and without all the fuss of bank integrations, user accounts etc.

As we launched Wally, we didn't expect to make a big impact and never strived for one. We were happy with creating a free tool that hopefully helped a few people.

Over time, the changes made to the app have been intentionally small, oftemost only to fit new form factors, notch devices etc. as well as new technology like biometric authentication.

However, as technology continues to take big leaps, it has become increasinly hard to not play around with all the cool things that are now possible. It's time to do so.


## The future of Wally

At the time of writing, a brand new version of Wally is being tested before being released into the wild. It's still a basic app on the surface, but underneath it's brand new.

Wally has been rewritten from scratch, using the latest technologies from Apple, such as SwiftUI 2, multiplatform support etc. While we only update the iOS app for now, we can now make it support iPadOS and macOS with little effort. 

In Wally 3.1, we will add a few features that have been requested by users for a long time. 

First of all, it will finally be possible to add card images from the photo album. Wally have never had this feature, since we wanted users to take pictures of physical cards. However, since anyone with access to the card image has access to its details, being able to import from the photo album does not impose a security risk.

Second, it will be possible to enter more information about each card, such as card name, card number and information. Cards with card number information will also be able generate barcodes and QR codes, which can be scanned.

Once the 3.1 version is out, Wally will move on to iOS 15 and make use of the improvements in this new iOS version. After that, we will start looking at new features and supporting more platforms.
