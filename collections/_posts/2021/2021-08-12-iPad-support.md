iPad support is coming to Wally. It will be available in the upcoming 3.2 version and will let you access your cards on all your mobile devices.

Adding iPad support to Wally has been a pretty smooth ride, where the biggest change has been how cards are presented and how they behave in your wallet. 

First of all, where the iPhone lists cards in a vertical list, iPads will use a grid instead, to let the cards take up more of the screen. The grid will be adaptive and adjust itself to the size of the screen, screen orientation etc.

Using a grid also limits what we can do with the cards, since a row should have the same height. Where the iPhone slides cards out from their pocket with a nice animation, the grid will instead bounce the cards without changing the height of the pocket. This animation may evolve in the future.

Keyboard shortcuts are also coming to the iPad app, but not just yet. It currently depends on which verison of Xcode you use, and the required version is not yet fully supported. Adding keyboard shortcuts will make the app even nicer.

Wally will not support syncing between devices, since that means storing the cards on a shared location. Instead, you will be able to send single cards and your entire wallet between your devices directly from the app.

Wally 3.2 is currently being beta tested, but will be released soon enough. It will probably be the last version that supports iOS 14, before moving on to exciting new features in iOS 15.
