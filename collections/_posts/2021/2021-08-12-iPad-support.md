iPad support is finally coming to Wally! It will be available in the upcoming 3.2 version and will let you access your cards on all your mobile devices.

Adding iPad support to Wally has been a pretty smooth ride, where the biggest change has been how cards are presented. Where the iPhone lists cards in a vertical list, iPads will use a grid to let the cards take up more of the screen. The grid will be adaptive and adjust itself to the size of the screen.

To get a little technical, Wally will use a grid regardless of device, but the configuration will be device-specific and use a single column on iPhone devices. This gives the iPhone and iPad a similar experience, while still honoring the compact space on iPhone and big screen of the iPad. The skeumorphism is also intact on both platforms.

The iPad app also supports keyboard shortcuts, but won't enable them just yet. It currently depends on the build tools, where the tools that are required to enable the shortcuts can not yet be used for App Store apps. The shortcuts are coming shortly, though.

As you now will be able to use Wally on all your mobile devices, you may want to sync data between devices. however, Wally does not support automatic data sync, since that would require you to store data on a shared location. Instead, you can send a single cards as well as your entire wallet between your devices directly from the app.

Wally 3.2 is currently being beta tested, but will be released soon. It will probably be the last version that supports iOS 14, before moving on to exciting new features in iOS 15.
