Wally 3.3 has been released, which brings back a features that some users have missed - the fullscreen card modal.

![iOS devices running Wally]({{page.image-trans}} "Wally once more has a fullscreen card modal")

It's amazing to get a 5 star review, but it's equally sad to get a 1 star review because something a user did love has been made worse. I hope that the user who did leave the one star review i shappy to see the feature return.

If you feel like something is being done in the wrong way in the app, there is a feedback button under settings. Not only does a feeback e-mail spark joy in the a developer's life, but it's also not as demotivating as seeing a 1 star review :)
